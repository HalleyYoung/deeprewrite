* Defining parts of a sonata
* Defining relationship between P, TR, and S
    * P and S are both somewhat similar to TR, but different from each other
    * TR is more restless than S
    * TR modulates to key x != key of P, S is in key x
* Development modulates a lot, contains material from P and material from S
* Recapitulation in same key as P, first close to P then close to S

* Defining properties of Hindustani music
    * Either unmetered or additive rhythm
    * Fixed raga with ornamentations on certain notes?
    * Non-diatonic scales

* Defining meter
    * Defining additive rhythm
        * Rarely go between beats of 3+2+2

    * Strong beats = (strong one on first down) + (more strong 1â€™s on other downbeats) + (some credit for half downbeats)
