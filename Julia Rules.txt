* Defining parts of a sonata
* Defining relationship between P, TR, and S
   * P and S are both somewhat similar to TR, but different from each other
   * TR is more restless than S
   * TR modulates to key x != key of P, S is in key x
* Development modulates a lot, contains material from P and material from S
* Recapitulation in same key as P, first close to P then close to S




* Defining properties of Hindustani music
   * Either unmetered or additive rhythm
   * Fixed raga with ornamentations on certain notes?
   * Non-diatonic scales
   * Tanbura drone
   * Tabla establishing additive rhythm


* Defining meter
   * Defining additive rhythm
      * Rarely go between beats of 3+2+2
   * Metric = sum(strong beats) + context
   * Strong beats = (strong one on first down) + (more strong 1’s on other downbeats) + (some credit for half downbeats)

* Defining distance
   * Part/whole subdivisions
   * Melody only similarity required
   * Accompaniment/Melody division

   * In relationship to meter
   * Types
      * Alberti bass
      * Pedal
      * Chords
      * Stride


* Defining types of textures
   * Melody-accompaniment
